# Some Practice in Data Structures and Algorithms + Input Validation for Java

This program was originally a project for a data structures and algorithms course. It has been modified to be a standalone repository.

The program does the following:

1. Sort a Java array with a self-made implimentation of Bubble sort that compares the first three letters of each state capital.
2. Provide a simple capital guessing game for the 50 states which validates entries using the sorted array.
3. Move the data into a hash map, followed by a treemap, in order to do a look-up of a provided state name.

This is one of my earliest java programs, so it provided it also served as a way of practicing multiple elements of Java, along with the struggles of getting the right version of Java in PATH to run the file.
